# Animated-Zombie
very important !!!
if you have shakes during the animation, you must reimport the model in 60 fps, disable the optimizer and put all the bones in "nearest" mode in the interpolation mode.

in the case of the zombie you have to put in "nearest" the "HIT" animation and the "ATK" animation.

you have to do it on all bones!

good game.
